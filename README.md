### Aim:

To create a program that will receive a waterfall image as an input and be able to accurately predict the signal type by using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Other possible features will be to allow inputs such as the bandwidth or centre frequency of the signal to help increase prediction accuracy.

A large part of this project will be to collect as much data possible to train the CNN model.

### Plan:

1. Build up a sufficient image database for every signal type using a range of sources
2. Modify the images appropriately for CNN input
3. Create the basic CNN
4. Optimise! Possibly include further inputs to improve accuracy.

### Stretch Goals:

- Including a GUI to upload or screen capture an image
- Availability for both Mac OS and Windows
